# Tic Tac Toe with Backtracking Search (BTS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dynamic Programming

This is a Python implementation of Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) with three different algorithms for finding the best move: Backtracking Search (BTS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dynamic Programming.

## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. This project provides a simple command-line interface to play Tic Tac Toe against the computer.

## Features

- Play Tic Tac Toe against the computer.
- Choose between different algorithms to determine the computer's move.
- BTS algorithm: Backtracking Search for finding the best move.
- DFS algorithm: Depth-First Search for finding the best move.
- Dynamic Programming algorithm for finding the best move.

## Algorithms

### Backtracking Search (BTS)

Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, removing solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time. In this project, BTS is used to search for the best move by exploring all possible moves recursively.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. In this project, DFS is employed to find the best move by exploring all possible moves in a depth-first manner.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. In this project, Dynamic Programming is utilized to efficiently compute the best move by storing and reusing solutions to subproblems.
